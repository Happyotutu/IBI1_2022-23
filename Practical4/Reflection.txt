I think this practical is very complex and difficcult. 
Because it's a lot of stuff and it's complicated
Making a website with GitHub pages is challenging for me. 
I don't know how to change the theme and I can't find my personal website entry at first.
But finally, I finished the practical by asking my classmates.
I feel a great sense of accomplishment after creating the website.
